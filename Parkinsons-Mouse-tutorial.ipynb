    "**_note:_ This guide assumes you have QIIME 2 installed (e.g. using this [procedure](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.10/install/native/)). To execute the script properly, open this notebook in a Jupyter Notebook from within a conda QIIME 2 environment.**\n",

    "**_note:_ This tutorial is an adaptation of the same tutorial that may be found on the [official QIIME 2 docs website](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.2/tutorials/atacama-soils/). The original tutorial uses the QIIME 2 CLI interface.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of CLI interface, this tutorial uses [Artifact API](https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.10/interfaces/artifact-api/) - a Python 3 application programmer interface (API) for QIIME 2. The Artifact API supports interactive computing with QIIME 2 using the Python 3 programming language. The API is automatically generated, and its availability depends on which QIIME 2 plugins are currently installed. It has been optimized for use in the Jupyter Notebook. The Artifact API is a part of the QIIME 2 framework; no additional software needs to be installed to use it. \n",

    "This document is intended to be run after the [moving pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.8/tutorials/moving-pictures/). It is designed to introduce a few new ideas, and to be an exercise in applying the tools that were explored in that document. \n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate a “typical” QIIME 2 analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon data, using a set of fecal samples from [humanized mice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanized_mouse). The original study, [Sampson et al, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27912057/), was designed to determine whether the fecal microbiome contributed to the development of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Several observation studies showed a difference in the microbiome between PD patients and controls, although the organisms identified across studies were not consistent. However, this was sufficient evidence to suggest that there might be a relationship between PD and the fecal microbiome.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether that relationship was incidental or actually disease associated, a second study was needed. A human cohort study was not feasible; the disease only affects about 1% of the population over 60 years old, PD takes a long time to develop and to be diagnosed, and it would be difficult to determine when to collect the samples. Therefore, a gnotobiotic mouse study was utilized to evaluate the role of the microbiome in the development of PD symptoms. Feces were collected from six donors with Parkinson’s disease and six age- and sex-matched neurologically health controls, and then transplanted into mice who were either predisposed to developing Parkinson’s disease due to a mutation (“aSyn”) or resistant wild type mice (“BDF1”). Mice from different donors were kept in separate cages, but mice from different genetic backgrounds were co-housed. The mice were followed for 7 weeks to see if they developed symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll look a subset of data from two human donors (one healthy and one with PD) whose samples were each transplanted into three separate cages of mice from the susceptible genotype. For this tutorial, a subset of the metadata has been prepared, and the sequences have been subsampled to approximately 5000 sequences per sample to allow the tutorial to run in a short time. The sequences for the full study are accessible at EBI with accession [PRJEB17694](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB17694); processed tables from the full study can be downloaded from the [Qiita](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/) database from study 10483."

The hypervariable region covered by the primers we used is 290bp long, so with 150bp reads our sequences will be slightly too short to be able to do paired-end analysis downstream. Therefore, we’re going to work with single-end sequences. We will work with a version of the samples which have already been demultiplexed, for example, by the sequencing center. If you need to demultiplex your sequences, the [Moving Pictures tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/moving-pictures/)describes how to demultiplex sequences if they were sequenced using the Earth Microbiome Project protocol.\n",

We will import the sequences using the sample [manifest format](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/importing/#manifest-file), a versatile way to import demultiplexed data in QIIME 2. We create a tab-separated sample manifest file that maps the sample name we want to use in QIIME 2 to the path of the sequence file. The benefit is that the demultiplexed sequence files can be named anything you want; there are not fixed assumptions about the conventions, and the file names do not dictate the final name. When QIIME 2 reads the file, it ignores any line prefixed with the # symbol. The first line that doesn’t contain a # is the header line and must be `sample-id<TAB>absolute-filepath`. The sample order after the header line does not matter.

    "There are several ways to construct a feature table in QIIME 2. The first major choice to make is to work with Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) or Absolute Sequence Variants (ASVs). OTUs have been widely used in microbiome research since the mid 2010s, and assign sequences to clusters either based on a reference database or de novo assignment. QIIME 2 offers clustering through [q2-vsearch](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/otu-clustering/) and [q2-dbOTU](https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/q2-dbotu/4/) plug-ins, currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASVs are a more recent development and provide better resolution in features than traditional OTU-based methods. ASVs can separate features based on differences of a single nucleotide in sequences of 400 bp or more, a resolution not possibly even with 99% identity OTU clustering. QIIME 2 currently offers denoising via [DADA2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27214047/) (dada2) and [Deblur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28289731/) (deblur). The major differences in the algorithms and motivation for denoising are nicely described in [Nearing et al, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30123705/).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting in either case that denoising to ASVs and clustering to OTUs are separate, but parallel steps. A choice should be made for a single pathway: either denoising or OTU based clustering; it is not recommended to combine the steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll denoise with DADA2 (using single-end sequences). Please see the [Atacama Soil tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/atacama-soils/) for an example of using DADA2 on paired-end sequences. For those interested in using Deblur, you can refer to the [Moving Pictures](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/moving-pictures/) tutorial and [Alternative methods of read joining](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/read-joining/) tutorial for running Deblur on single- and paired-end sequences, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The qiime `dada2.methods.denoise_single` method requires us to set the `trunc_len` parameter. This controls the length of the sequences and should be selected based on a drop in quality scores. In our dataset, the quality scores are relatively evenly distributed along the sequencing run, so we’ll use the full 150 bp sequences. However, the selection of the trim length is a relatively subjective measurement and relies on the decision making capacity of the analyst."

We want to set a maximum depth close to the maximum number of sequences.

Selecting a rarefaction depth is an exercise in minimizing sequence loss while maximizing the sequences retained for diversity analysis. For high-biomass samples (fecal, oral, etc), a general best estimate is a rarefaction depth of no less than 1000 sequences per sample. In low biomass samples where sequencing is shallower, a lower rarefaction depth may be selected although it’s important to keep in mind that the diversity measurements on these samples will be quite noisy and the overall quality will be low."

To do this, we’ll use the `feature_classifier` plugin to classify ASVs taxonomically.\n",

[This classifier works](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-018-0470-z) by identifying k-mers that are diagnostic for particular taxonomic groups, and using that information to predict the taxonomic affiliation of each ASV.

These indicate that there is not enough information for the Greengenes database to differentiate members of that clade, either due to ambiguity in the database or because the gene region being sequenced doesn’t provide the resolution to distinguish members of that clade. This is distinct from cases where `feature_classifier` cannot reliably classify the ASV to a deeper level: in those cases, an incomplete taxonomy string will be provided. Hence, you may see two different types of “underclassification” in your data: e.g., `k__Bacteria`; `p__Firmicutes; c__Clostridia; o__Clostridiales; f__Christensenellaceae; g__; s__` (genus and species annotations are missing in Greengenes) as well as `k__Bacteria; p__Firmicutes; c__Clostridia; o__Clostridiales; f__Christensenellaceae` (`feature_classifier` could not confidently classify that ASV at genus level).\n",

    "Many microbiome investigators are interested in testing whether individual ASVs or taxa are more or less abundant in different sample groups. This is known as differential abundance. Microbiome data present several challenges for performing differential abundance using convential methods. Microbiome abundance data are inherently sparse (have a lot of zeros) and compositional (everything adds up to 1). Because of this, traditional statistical methods that you may be familiar with, such as ANOVA or t-tests, are not appropriate for performing differential abundance tests of microbiome data and lead to a high false-positive rate. ANCOM is a compositionally aware alternative that allows to test for differentially abundant features. If you’re unfamiliar with the technique, it’s worthwhile to review the [ANCOM paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26028277/) to better understand the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we will filter out low abundance/low prevalence ASVs. Filtering can provide better resolution and limit false discovery rate (FDR) penalty on features that are too far below the noise threshhold to be applicable to a statistical test. A feature that shows up with 10 counts may be a real feature that is present only in that sample, may be a feature that’s present in several samples but only got amplified and sequenced in one sample because PCR is a somewhat stochastic process, or it may be noise. It’s not possible to tell, so feature-based analysis may be better after filtering low abundance features. However, filtering also shifts the composition of a sample, further disrupting the relationship. Here, the filtering is performed as a trade off between the model, computational efficiency, and statistical practicality."

We can use the `longitudinal` plug-in to explore the hypothesis that a mouse’s genetic background affected the change in the microbial community of each mouse. For this longitudinal analysis, we’re going to focus on beta diversity. Alpha diversity changes wildly in infants, but it’s often stable in adults over short time periods. We’re dealing with an adult fecal community over a relatively short time period, and there is no difference in alpha diversity with time.

For this analysis, we’re interested in whether genotype affects the longitudinal change in the microbial community. However, we also know from our cross sectional analysis that donor plays a large role in shaping the fecal community. So, we should also probably include that in this analysis. We may also want to consider cage effect in our experiment, since this is a common confounder in rodent studies. However, the original experimental design here was clever: although cages were grouped by donor (mice are coprophagic), they were of mixed genotype. This partial randomization helps limit some of the cage effects we might otherwise see.\n",

    "Importantly, LME models also allow us to distinguish between two types of independent variables: fixed effects (e.g., experimental treatments) and random effects (e.g., biological factors that cannot be controlled in the experiment). By default, the `linear_mixed_effects` action in `longitudinal` uses the `individual_id_column` as a random effect, since we can expect that biological differences between individual subjects will impact the baseline values of the dependent variable we are testing. The rate of change — slope — is another inter-individual effect that we often might want to consider as a random effect in longitudinal experiments. See the [longitudinal analysis](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/longitudinal/) tutorial for more details and discussion of LME tests and effect types."

    "As an alternative (or complementary) approach to the methods we have used in this tutorial for testing if and how samples are different from one another, we can utilize [machine-learning methods](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/sample-classifier/) to determine how predictive microbiome composition is of other characteristics about a sample. For example, we may use machine-learning classifiers to predict a patient’s susceptibility to disease, or predict the treatment group that a sample belongs to. Additionally, many machine-learning methods report which features are most important for predicting sample characteristics, making this a useful approach for determining which features (ASVs, species, etc) are associated with a particular treatment, disease state, or other category of interest. All of this and much more can be found in the `sample_classifier` plugin. Here we will use this plugin to predict each mouse’s genotype and donor status based on their ASV composition using a Random Forest classifier (this pipeline can access many different machine-learning methods via the `estimator parameter`, but Random Forest classifiers are used by default)."
