The Artifact API supports interactive computing with QIIME 2 using the Python 3 programming language. The API is automatically generated, and its availability depends on which QIIME 2 plugins are currently installed. It has been optimized for use in the Jupyter Notebook.

A study based on these samples was originally published in [Caporaso et al. (2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624126). The data used in this tutorial were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq using the [Earth Microbiome Project](http://earthmicrobiome.org/) hypervariable region 4 (V4) 16S rRNA sequencing protocol.\n",

    "\n",
    "QIIME 2 plugins are available for several quality control methods, including DADA2, Deblur, and basic quality-score-based filtering. In this tutorial we present this step using [DADA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214047) and [Deblur](https://msystems.asm.org/content/2/2/e00191-16). These steps are interchangeable, so you can use whichever of these you prefer. The result of both of these methods will be a `FeatureTable[Frequency]` QIIME 2 artifact, which contains counts (frequencies) of each unique sequence in each sample in the dataset, and a `FeatureData[Sequence]` QIIME 2 artifact, which maps feature identifiers in the `FeatureTable` to the sequences they represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option 1: DADA2\n",
    "\n",
    "[DADA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214047) is a pipeline for detecting and correcting (where possible) Illumina amplicon sequence data. As implemented in the `q2-dada2` plugin, this quality control process will additionally filter any phiX reads (commonly present in marker gene Illumina sequence data) that are identified in the sequencing data, and will filter chimeric sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dada2.methods.denoise_single` method requires two parameters that are used in quality filtering: `trim_left`, which trims off the first `m` bases of each sequence, and `trunc_len` which truncates each sequence at position `n`. This allows the user to remove low quality regions of the sequences. To determine what values to pass for these two parameters, you should review the Interactive Quality Plot tab in the `demux.qzv` file that was generated by qiime demux summarize above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `demux.qzv` quality plots, we see that the quality of the initial bases seems to be high, so we won’t trim any bases from the beginning of the sequences. The quality seems to drop off around position 120, so we’ll truncate our sequences at 120 bases. This next command may take up to 10 minutes to run, and is the slowest step in this tutorial.\n"

    "Next, the Deblur workflow is applied using the `deblur.methods.denoise-16S method`. This method requires one parameter that is used in quality filtering, `trim_length = n` which truncates the sequences at position `n`. In general, the Deblur developers recommend setting this value to a length where the median quality score begins to drop too low. On these data, the quality plots (prior to quality filtering) suggest a reasonable choice is in the 115 to 130 sequence position range. This is a subjective assessment. One situation where you might deviate from that ecommendation is when performing a meta-analysis across multiple sequencing runs. In this type of meta-analysis, it is critical that the read lengths be the same for all of the sequencing runs being compared to avoid introducing a study-specific bias. Since 120 is reasonable given the quality plots, we’ll pass `trim_length` parameter the value of 120. This next command may take up to 10 minutes to run."

    "QIIME supports several phylogenetic diversity metrics, including Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity and weighted and unweighted UniFrac. In addition to counts of features per sample (i.e., the data in the `FeatureTable[Frequency]` QIIME 2 artifact), these metrics require a rooted phylogenetic tree relating the features to one another. This information will be stored in a `Phylogeny[Rooted]` QIIME 2 artifact. To generate a phylogenetic tree we will use `phylogeny.pipelines.align_to_tree_mafft_fasttree` pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the pipeline uses the `mafft` program to perform a multiple sequence alignment of the sequences in our `FeatureData[Sequence]` to create a `FeatureData[AlignedSequence]` QIIME 2 artifact. Next, the pipeline masks (or filters) the alignment to remove positions that are highly variable. These positions are generally considered to add noise to a resulting phylogenetic tree. Following that, the pipeline applies FastTree to generate a phylogenetic tree from the masked alignment. The FastTree program creates an unrooted tree, so in the final step in this section midpoint rooting is applied to place the root of the tree at the midpoint of the longest tip-to-tip distance in the unrooted tree."

    "QIIME 2’s diversity analyses are available through the `q2-diversity` plugin, which supports computing alpha and beta diversity metrics, applying related statistical tests, and generating interactive visualizations. We’ll first apply the `diversity.pipelines.core_metrics_phylogenetic` method, which rarefies a `FeatureTable[Frequency]` to a user-specified depth, computes several alpha and beta diversity metrics, and generates principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots using Emperor for each of the beta diversity metrics. The metrics computed by default are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alpha diversity\n",
    "    * Shannon’s diversity index (a quantitative measure of community richness)\n",
    "    * Observed OTUs (a qualitative measure of community richness)\n",
    "    * Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (a qualitiative measure of community richness that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)\n",
    "    * Evenness (or Pielou’s Evenness; a measure of community evenness)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Beta diversity\n",
    "    * Jaccard distance (a qualitative measure of community dissimilarity)\n",

    "    * weighted UniFrac distance (a quantitative measure of community dissimilarity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships between the features)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important parameter that needs to be provided to this script is `sampling_depth`, which is the even sampling (i.e. rarefaction) depth. Because most diversity metrics are sensitive to different sampling depths across different samples, this script will randomly subsample the counts from each sample to the value provided for this parameter. For example, if you provide `sampling_depth = 500`, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500. If the total count for any sample(s) are smaller than this value, those samples will be dropped from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky. We recommend making your choice reviewing the information presented in the table that was created above. Choose a value that is as high as possible (so you retain more sequences per sample) while excluding as few samples as possible. \n",
    "> Question 5: View the above mentioned QIIME 2 artifact containing table, and in particular the _Interactive Sample Detail_ tab in that visualization. What value would you choose to pass for  `sampling_depth`? How many samples will be excluded from your analysis based on this choice? How many total sequences will you be analyzing in the  `core_metrics_phylogenetic ` pipeline?"

The following commands will test whether distances between samples within a group, such as samples from the same body site (e.g., gut), are more similar to each other then they are to samples from the other groups (e.g., tongue, left palm, and right palm). It will also perform pairwise tests that will allow you to determine which specific pairs of groups (e.g., tongue and gut) differ from one another, if any. This command can be slow to run, especially when running pairwise analysis, since it is based on permutation tests. So, unlike the previous commands, we’ll run this on specific columns of metadata that we’re interested in exploring, rather than all metadata columns that it’s applicable to. Here we’ll apply this to our unweighted UniFrac distances, using two sample metadata columns, as follows."

While our `diversity.pipelines.core_metrics_phylogenetic` command did already generate some Emperor plots, we want to pass an optional parameter, `custom_axes`, which is very useful for exploring time series data. The PCoA results that were used in `core-metrics-phylogeny` are also available, making it easy to generate new visualizations with Emperor. We will generate Emperor plots for unweighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis so that the resulting plot will contain axes for principal coordinate 1, principal coordinate 2, and days since the experiment start. We will use that last axis to explore how these samples changed over time."

This visualizer computes one or more alpha diversity metrics at multiple sampling depths, in steps between 1 (optionally controlled with `min_depth` and the value provided as `max_depth`. At each sampling depth step, 10 rarefied tables will be generated, and the diversity metrics will be computed for all samples in the tables. The number of iterations (rarefied tables computed at each sampling depth) can be controlled with `iterations`. Average diversity values will be plotted for each sample at each even sampling depth, and samples can be grouped based on metadata in the resulting visualization if sample metadata is provided with the `metadata` parameter."

If the lines in the plot appear to “level out” (i.e., approach a slope of zero) at some sampling depth along the x-axis, that suggests that collecting additional sequences beyond that sampling depth would not be likely to result in the observation of additional features. If the lines in a plot don’t level out, this may be because the richness of the samples hasn’t been fully observed yet (because too few sequences were collected), or it could be an indicator that a lot of sequencing error remains in the data (which is being mistaken for novel diversity).\n",

    "The bottom plot in this visualization is important when grouping samples by metadata. It illustrates the number of samples that remain in each group when the feature table is rarefied to each sampling depth. If a given sampling depth `d` is larger than the total frequency of a sample `s` (i.e., the number of sequences that were obtained for sample `s`), it is not possible to compute the diversity metric for sample s at sampling depth `d`. If many of the samples in a group have lower total frequencies than `d`, the average diversity presented for that group at `d` in the top plot will be unreliable because it will have been computed on relatively few samples. When grouping samples by metadata, it is therefore essential to look at the bottom plot to ensure that the data presented in the top plot is reliable.\n",

This classifier was trained on the Greengenes 13_8 99% OTUs, where the sequences have been trimmed to only include 250 bases from the region of the 16S that was sequenced in this analysis (the V4 region, bound by the 515F/806R primer pair).

    "ANCOM can be applied to identify features that are differentially abundant (i.e. present in different abundances) across sample groups. As with any bioinformatics method, you should be aware of the assumptions and limitations of ANCOM before using it. We recommend reviewing the [ANCOM paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028277) before using this method.\n",

    "Differential abundance testing in microbiome analysis is an active area of research. There are two QIIME 2 plugins that can be used for this: `gneiss` and `composition`.

    "\n",
    "ANCOM is implemented in the `composition` plugin. ANCOM assumes that few (less than about 25%) of the features are changing between groups. If you expect that more features are changing between your groups, you should not use ANCOM as it will be more error-prone (an increase in both Type I and Type II errors is possible). Because we expect a lot of features to change in abundance across body sites, in this tutorial we’ll filter our full feature table to only contain gut samples. We’ll then apply ANCOM to determine which, if any, sequence variants and genera are differentially abundant across the gut samples of our two subjects.\n",

To do this, we can collapse the features in our `FeatureTable[Frequency]` at the taxonomic level of interest, and then re-run the above steps.
